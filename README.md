# Query-to-File

_Polypheny Query-to-File_ lets you materialize the result of an arbitrary query as a file system (set of files in a folder). All files that are materialized in the mounted folder are kept in memory. Multimedia files are initially empty. As you open a multimedia file, the content will be fetched from Polypheny-DB, loaded into memory and then returned. This can lead to waiting times, and your file explorer might not react during this moment.

In addition to executing and materializing an arbitrary query, it is also possible to provide a schema and table name (`schema.table`). The whole table will then be fetched and materialized. The files can be opened, edited. It is also possible to copy the files to a different location. Missing column files can be added (make sure to use the correct filename, the extension does not matter.).

Query-to-File supports transactions. All changes (edited files) are executed in one transaction by clicking the  _commit_ button. Uncommitted changes are lost when executing another query.

## Setup

In order to use the tool, you need to have FUSE installed on your computer. See this [installation guide](https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) for more information. Furthermore, you need to have Java version 8 or higher installed on your system.

After setting up the FUSE library, configure the path to the fuse binary in the `config.properties` file. The file already contains some typical locations for different operating systems. In the config file, you can also configure the hostname and port of the Polypheny-DB instance.

## Limitations

This software is still considered beta. There are still some major limitations:

* Windows is not yet supported (MacOS and Linux are working fine).
* No support for DELETE and INSERT operations.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-DB/labels/A-qtf) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
