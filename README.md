# Query-to-File

The Query-to-File tool lets you materialize the result of a query as a set of files in a folder. In order to use the tool, you need to install a FUSE library on your computer. See this [installation guide](https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) for more information.
